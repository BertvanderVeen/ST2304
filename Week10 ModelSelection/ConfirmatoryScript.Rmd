# Instructions

* This html will remind you of the code needed to do confirmatory model selection
* It will have hints and suggests for the steps you need to do confirmatory model selection
* Data will be named YourData and models YourModel - **you should change these
to the name you decide to give your data and models**

**The variable names are also different here as examples are on 
different data to what you have.
Results will also be different**

# Help and hints (and pictures because it was a bit boring)

```{r Start, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(SMPracticals)
darwin

YourModel1 <- lm(height ~ 1, data = darwin)
YourModel2 <- lm(height ~ type, data = darwin)
```

Below are a list of click down sections, each covers a different part of the
analysis. Use whichever you need. Also try to have a go on your own when you
can, you can always check after if you got it right. 

In confirmatory model selection you want to test a specific hypothesis.

```{r ANOVA, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, evaluate = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
anova(YourModel1, YourModel2) 
```

**Hint: check the degrees of freedom to see if you put them in the right order. 
The degrees of freedom
should make sense i.e. be positive**

Therefore, you need to think about a null and alternative hypothesis and a 
way to compare them statistically. (This part involves a few steps).

Then, as with every analysis, you will want to look at the results and make 
a conclusion. Hint - it includes rejecting or not the null hypothesis. 

<details><summary>I really don't know which steps!! (or I just want to be sure)</summary>

The first step in confirmatory model selection is to work out what your
H0 (null hypothesis) and H1 (alternative hypothesis) are. 

Once you have worked this out you should run a linear model for each of these.
**You should know the code to do this by now.** Make sure to save them as objects
e.g. `YourModelH0 <- lm()`, because you will use them in other functions later.

Then find a way to compare the results statistically. You can do this using
the `anova()` function to compare them.

Now you need to interpret the output of the `anova()`. 
Below is an example from a **different** dataset, in the next section.

Finally, you would need to interpret the output of the 'chosen' model.

**The degrees of freedom HERE begins as: n (number of data points). 
But is usually n-1**

The columns are: 

* Res.DF - residual degrees of freedom, those left after number of parameters 
estimated has been removed 
(here, we have estimated an intercept in both (n-1), 
and a slope too in one of our models (n-2))
* RSS - residual sum of squares. Sum of squared distances between estimate 
and data points. Estimate
can be a mean or a regression line depending on the model.
* DF - difference in degrees of freedom between the two models.
* Sum of Sq - the RSS of the H0 model - RSS of the H1 model.
* F - F statistic. Calculated as (Sum of Sq/df)/(RSS of H1/DF H1). 
Here that is (51.352/1)/(242.08/28) = 5.9395
* Pr(>F) - the probability of getting the F value you have or higher IF
 H0 were true. Here it is 0.02141, which is a 2.141 % chance that we would see
 the F statistic we estimated or higher IF H0 were true. 

```{r AN2, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
anova(YourModel1, YourModel2) 
```

To make this an interpretation, the main thing we need is the Pr(>F) value,
called the p-value. You might have come across this in another course. The
typical threshold for this is 0.05, anything less than this is considered to
be unlikely if H0 were true. (5% chance of seeing the result or higher). But
this is a bit arbitrary. You could choose 0.01 instead if you want to be 
really sure, or 0.1 if you don't need much confidence. The p-value does not
tell you anything about the strength of any relationships though, for that
you need the coefficients of the chosen `lm()` and their confidence intervals.

To draw a conclusion, you want to focus on whether you reject or not H0. 

**Never accept H0 or H1, just reject H0 or don't.** The p-value does not tell
you how likely either H0 or H1 are to be true.

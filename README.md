# ST2304

This is the material for ST2304 Statistisk modellering for biologer/bioteknologer (or ST2304 Statistical modelling for biologists/bioteknologists). It includes a module for each week, and exercises starting at week 3. I have not included the answers to the exercises, for obvious reasons.

The videos are hosted on NTNU's Panopto site.

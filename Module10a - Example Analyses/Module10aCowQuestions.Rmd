These data are from an experiment on cows. Cows were split into 6 groups, each given a different diet treatment. Here you will look at how these different treatments influenced the dry matter intake (DMI) of the cows.

You can find the data [here](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2020v/Week09/cowdata.csv): it is a .csv with a header.

Important! When you import the data it is important to make sure it is in the right format. Here you need Treatment to be a factor and Baseline to be numeric. See code below.

```{r ImportCowData}
cowdata <- read.csv("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2020v/Week09/cowdata.csv", header=T)

# str() checks the data structure
str(cowdata)

# we can see that the variables are not the right format
# so we fix it
cowdata$Treatment <- as.factor(cowdata$Treatment)
cowdata$Baseline <- as.numeric(cowdata$Baseline)

# now check again
str(cowdata)
```


The columns in the dataframe are:

- DMI = the dry matter intake during the experiment (grams)
- Baseline = the baseline dry matter intake before the experiment (grams)
- Treatment = the diet treatment group (1 to 6)

You want to find out how diet treatment influenced dry matter intake while controlling for the baseline intake of each cow.

<span style="color:blue">1. What model will you use to answer this?</span> (1 mark)

<span style="color:blue">2. What type of variables do you have and which are response or explanatory?</span> (3 marks)

We have given code to run a model for the data below. Think about what type of model is being run? It is good practice to consider if you would have chosen the same one.

```{r model1}
# Model 1
model1 <- lm(DMI ~ Treatment+Baseline, data = cowdata)

coef(model1)

confint(model1)
```

<span style="color:blue">3. Interpret the output of the model. What does it tell you about the effect of diet on DMI?</span> (5 marks)

Below is the code to make some graphs to check the model fit.

```{r modelCheck}

# Graph 1

residuals <- residuals(model1)
fitted <- fitted(model1)
plot(fitted, residuals)

qqnorm(residuals)
qqline(residuals)
```

<span style="color:blue">4. What are the assumptions of the model?</span> (5 marks)

<span style="color:blue">5. Are the assumptions met? Reference which plot you use to decide and why you make the choice.</span> (6 marks)

<span style="color:blue">6. What other plot might you also want for checking assumptions?</span> (1 mark)

Here is code for another model on the same data.

```{r model2}
# Model 2
model2 <- lm(DMI ~ Treatment*Baseline, data = cowdata)

coef(model2)

confint(model2)

# knitr::kable is used here to remove some decimals.
knitr::kable(anova(model2), digits = 2)
```

<span style="color:blue">7. How is this model different to the first one?</span> (1 mark)

<span style="color:blue">8. Given the new model, does this change your interpretation of the effect of diet on DMI? Why?</span> (4 marks)

<span style="color:blue">9. Which model do you prefer, why?</span> (4 marks)
